    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Utah by the name of Delta. It's a thriving metropolis of about 3500 people. Most people
    don't think there's a lot to do out there, 100 miles from the nearest real city, but I always managed to find plenty to
    do to keep busy. I left for an LDS mission to Texas and then school at BYU where I met my wife. We've been in the Provo-Orem
     area since.</p>

<div id="family">
    <h2>Family</h2>
    <img id="family_pic" src="src/img/family_KY.jpg" alt="Picture of my family including my wife and our children, two boys
    and three girls."/>
    <p>I have been married for 18 years and have 5 children. My wife is from Georgia and we met while going to school.
        Our children range in age from 14 to 3. We have lived in south Orem for the last 8 years.</p>

<div id="interests">
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I love languages. I speak Spanish and have spent some time learning French, Italian, &amp; Arabic.</p>
    <p>I love any kind of game, board games, video games, cards, and especially sports.</p>

    <p>As a family we love to travel to visit family. Delta, where I grew up, is always a favorite because my parents live there, and as my
        oldest says, &quot;It's the country, you can do anything there.&quot; We also love to visit my wife's dad in Texas. It's a long trip, but
        the kids love being at his house. The weather is always warm and there is a lot for them to do. They love the different creatures that
        they can catch as well.</p>

<div id="future">
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>I'd love to be able to take the skills that I learn in my web development course and turn it into a career. I'll start
    off helping my wife with her business web site and play around with miscellaneous pursuits until then.</p>
